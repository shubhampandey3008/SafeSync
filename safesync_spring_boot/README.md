The platform serves as a centralized hub for disaster-related
communications, allowing entities like police, fire brigade, and hospitals to
input operational data during disasters. The LLM interprets urgency and
context using data embeddings, ensuring critical updates reach the right
teams promptly. It provides a summarized situation overview, aiding
decision-making. Historical data analysis improves disaster management strategies. The Spring Boot application communicates with the LLM, receiving responses and publishing them to Kafka for processing and
distribution to relevant stakeholders.
